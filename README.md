# 🧠 JavaScript & React Practice

This repository contains a collection of solved exercises and small projects completed during my self-study of JavaScript and React. It includes fundamental challenges, real-world scenarios, and component-based logic — all organized for easy reference and continuous growth.

## 🎯 Purpose

To reinforce core programming concepts and deepen understanding of:

- JavaScript fundamentals (ES6+)
- DOM manipulation
- Async programming (Promises, Fetch, async/await)
- React components, hooks & state management
- Clean, readable, and modular code
